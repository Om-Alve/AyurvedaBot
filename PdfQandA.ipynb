You should do activities like evening meditation and basking in the moonlight. You should practice moderate-paced, noncompetitive morning yoga. You should also eat cooling foods like melons and cucumbers, and have a snack in between meals. In your yoga practice, you should turn the heat down or off, teach a light-hearted, cooling class with less focus on precision of alignment, and more focus on inner awareness. Incorporate poses that spotlight the navel like spinal twists and forward bends. You should also skip headstand or keep the hold very short, and end the practice with sheetali or sheetkari pranayama to cool down any acquired heat.'"
